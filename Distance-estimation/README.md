# Distance Estimation Range increase with optical flow

> The detection Ranged is increase, using optical, since when PyZbar fails ⚠️ optical able to garb the detection responsibility on it head, it does pretty good job over on detection, part, here you will see the comparison of Pyzbar, how  much times optical flow improve the detection
